# MoQ & LL-DASH Data Repository

This repo contains the following folders:

## DASH Analysis

This folder contains the data and analysis of all our LL-DASH experiments regarding the influence of different network conditions on the latency and reliability of LL-DASH.

## MoQ Analysis

This folder contains the data and analysis of all our MoQ experiments regarding the influence of different streaming parameters (e.g., resolution, bitrate, GoP size) and network conditions on the latency and reliability of LL-DASH.

## MoQ DASH Comparison

This folder contains notebooks to compare the latency and reliability of MoQ and LL-DASH under different network conditions.

## MoQ Quality

This folder contains the data and analysis of our MoQ quality experiments. Here, we measure the VMAF score of different GoP sizes under various network conditions.

## MoQ Remote Subscriber

This folder contains a notebook to merge the frame data of the publisher with the frame data of the remote subscriber into a format that can then be used by the scripts within the MoQ Analysis folder.
